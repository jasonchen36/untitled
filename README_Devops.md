# TaxPlan Web - Devops #

## Software Architecture (High Level) ##

The Node.js server is run on Ubuntu 14 using [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as a http proxy and [Upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/) as a keep-alive daemon.  

[Foreman](https://github.com/strongloop/node-foreman) is used instead of Grunt or the raw node command to run the server. It uses a Procfile to manage Node processes separately and loads environment variables from the .env file.


## Nginx ##

The config file is located at /etc/nginx/sites-available/default on the remote server


## Upstart ##

The config file is located at /etc/init/taxplanweb.conf on the remote server

The service is set to spawn on server start and automatically respawn itself.  You can manually start it using:
```
sudo service taxplanweb start
```


## Foreman ##

You can use Foreman to export the config env files for production using:
```
sudo nf export -o /etc/init
```
